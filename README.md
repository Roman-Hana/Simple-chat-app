# Description

I created a shared chat room where I can communicate with other users. On the site you can register with a google account and discuss anything or all messages and users will be saved on the cloud firestore.  I used the following stack of technologies to create the site: JavaScript / ReactJs, React router / CSS, Material UI / Firebase (auth, db).
